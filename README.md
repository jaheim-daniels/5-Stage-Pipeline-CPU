# 5-Stage-Pipeline-CPU

# This repository contains an implementation of a 5-stage pipelined CPU written in Verilog.
The design follows the classic pipeline stages:

Instruction Fetch (IF)

Instruction Decode (ID)

Execute (EX)

Memory Access (MEM)

Write Back (WB)

# The project is divided into multiple lab files (Lab1.v, Lab2.v, etc.), each corresponding to different stages or milestones of the CPU implementation.
